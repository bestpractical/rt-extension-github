NAME
    RT-Extension-GitHub - Tools to integrate RT with GitHub

DESCRIPTION
    This extension provides tools and features that are useful if you use
    GitHub for version control and possibly GitHub Actions for CI and you
    track your work in RT.

RT VERSION
    Works with RT 5.0

INSTALLATION
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
        May need root permissions

    Edit your /opt/rt4/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm
        Add this line:

            Plugin('RT::Extension::GitHub');

    Clear your mason cache
            rm -rf /opt/rt4/var/mason_data/obj

    Restart your webserver

CONFIGURATION
  Queues for Github Actions
    Set the following to define which queues should show the Github Actions
    portlet with test results for a branch:

        Set( $GitHubActions, {
            Queues => [ 'General' ] }
        );

    The extension expects the subject of tickets to be the name of the
    branch to try to fetch test results for.
